# Microservices in go

Simple, fun-type, project started to experiment with (and learn) golang and to test how to write small&quick microservices efficiently in this setup.

No practical use. No ambitions to be beautiful code example either. 

Libraries used:

* gin - http framework/router to provide REST API
* mgo - MongoDB driver to get data from a DB
* nats - client for nats messaging to connect all microservice instances together

Other:

* MongoDB
* Docker (optional)
